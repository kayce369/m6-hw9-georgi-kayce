# ASSIGNMENT 9: WEATHER WIDGET

**Kayce Georgi**

## Issues

Again, I relied heavily on the recorded lecture to help me get started on this assignment, but eventually it clicked.

I didn't run into many issues - luckily, OpenWeatherAPI is commonly used enough I could find some easy solutions online. I mainly got stuck trying to figure out how to display the weather icon.
